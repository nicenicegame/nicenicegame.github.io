# Greeting! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tatpol Samakpong, a Software Engineer.

## About Me

I'm passionate about all things technology and enjoy creating software that solves real-world problems. I specialize in web development, with a focus on front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I graduated from XYZ University with a degree in Computer Science and have been working in the industry for over 5 years. In that time, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small websites to large-scale web applications.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing video games, or reading a good book. I also enjoy giving back to the community and have volunteered my time with local non-profit organizations.
